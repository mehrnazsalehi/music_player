create an mp3 music player in which can play the song, pause it, resume it, and navigate from the current song to the next song as well as previous songs.
We used Python and its libraries. The first library that we used is PyQt5 and also used mutagen which is a Python module to handle audio metadata.
Next, we will be using the mixer module of a very famous python library called Pygame.
Pygame is basically used to create video games, it includes computer graphics and sound libraries. Mixer is one such sound library. Then, we will use the os library of python to interact with the Operating system.
